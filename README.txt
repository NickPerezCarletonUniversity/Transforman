HOW TO PLAY:
1) Open TransforMan.jar with the Java VM.

2) Your objective in each level is to reach the goal.

3) An optional objective is to collect all of the energy cells (the small spinning diamonds).

4) Press Q, W, E, and R on the keyboard to shapeshift into different forms.
   Some transformations are only available on later levels.

   R = Square   (level 1+)
   E = Circle   (level 4+)
   W = Star     (level 6+)
   Q = Triangle (level 8+)

   Square form (basic):
     - TransforMan can move on the ground and in the air using the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys.
     - He can jump using the SPACEBAR.

   Circle form (wall jump):
     - TransforMan has extremely high friction, so he will stick to the ground without sliding.
     - He cannot move left or right when on the ground.
     - He also cannot jump while on the ground, and can only move by transforming first.
     - TransforMan can stick to walls by holding LEFT or RIGHT (toward the wall).
     - He can jump diagonally away from a wall by pressing SPACEBAR while touching it.

   Star form (smash/dig):
     - TransforMan can move left and right, but cannot jump.
     - His spikes will destroy any wood or dirt blocks that he comes in contact with.

   Triangle form (reverse gravity):
     - In this form, TransforMan can move normally just like Square form.
     - However, he cannot jump very high, as gravity is amplified.
     - If he comes very close to the ceiling, gravity will reverse.
     - Similarily, if gravity is reversed and he comes very close to the ground,
       gravity will return to its natural direction.
     - If at any time he switches to a different form, gravity will return to normal.
